# accent-mark-helper

## Summary

A simple Chrome extension that helps the user type accented characters, similar to Babbel's functionality.

## What it does

If you aren't familiar with [Babbel.com's](https://babbel.com) typing functionality, it helps users type characters that do not exist on their keyboard without having to use some external tool or OS utility such as Character Map for Windows.

Here is how Babbel enables users studying Italian to properly type accented characters in the Italian alphabet:

Typing the sequence of characters under the accented character converts that sequence into the desired character. For example, typing `a//` converts to `Ã ` and so on.

This extension does exactly that, but on all other websites. (It is disabled for `babbel.com/*` domains.)
